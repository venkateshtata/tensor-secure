This is a convolutional neural network which can classify between trained images and untrained images.
This program can be hosted on a raspberry pi and the raspberry camera knows if the person in front of the camera 
is familiar or not.

The above ANN is currently trained with the images of animals, if you want to train your device woth your face, then remove
the file named "weights-classifier.hdf5", which has the weights of the prevously trained neurons, and run the "cnn.py" file 
in your terminal, then a new weight valued file gets created, which has the training data of your face.

Any doubts, mail me at "venkateshtata9@gmail.com".
Thankyou.
